This is a Shoe E-commerce mobile app that I have designed on figma then converted my design from figma to html and css. I designed three frames where we have the first frame haveing the land page. On the landing page, we have all types of shoes both male and female with ratings on each shoe. We also have types of shoes gruoped to categories and one can click on let us say heels and you will get to see a variety of heels in stock. When a shoe is clicked it will take you to the secong page which has the details of the shoe with its variants which is color and size and price of the shoe. We also have a description of the shoe and the buy now button. On the third page we have where the seller adds the products to the store. We have the product name, a description of the product and the product tag with the pricing and adding to stock or removing from stock. I chose this design because it is easy for the end users to interact with since they are the consumers of the product. The users will be able to directly go to the product they want and even choose the color they want. For the owner to add produts is also straight forward and anyone is able to add products to the store.
